A framework agnostic authorization library based on policies.

## Authorization not Authentication

This library intends to provide a policy based framework around authorization and access
control. Authentication is a [separate concern](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Separation_of_concerns) that has been
packaged into a separate [authentication library](https://github.com/Phauthentic/authentication).

## Installation

Install it via [Composer](http://getcomposer.org):

```
composer require phauthentic/authorization
```
